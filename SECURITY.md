# Security Recommendations for TGTHR Outreach PWA

## Current Security Posture ✅
- HTTPS transport encryption (required for PWA)
- Salesforce platform security (SOC 2, HIPAA compliant)
- Local device storage (no cloud storage of PHI)
- JWT authentication for API access

## Recommended Security Enhancements 🔒

### 1. Add Request/Response Encryption
```typescript
// Encrypt sensitive data before API calls
const encryptedPayload = await encrypt(sensitiveData, deviceKey);
```

### 2. Device Authentication
```typescript
// Add device registration/authentication
const deviceToken = await registerDevice();
```

### 3. Data Retention Policy
```typescript
// Auto-purge local data after sync + retention period
const RETENTION_DAYS = 30;
await purgeOldRecords(RETENTION_DAYS);
```

### 4. Audit Logging
```typescript
// Log all PHI access/transmission
await logAccess(userId, action, timestamp, ipAddress);
```

## Production Deployment Checklist 📋

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Use HTTPS everywhere (TLS 1.3+)
- [ ] Deploy behind WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- [ ] Enable CORS restrictions
- [ ] Set up rate limiting
- [ ] Configure CSP headers

### Application
- [ ] Add input validation/sanitization
- [ ] Implement session timeouts
- [ ] Add device registration
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Set up data retention policies

### Compliance
- [ ] HIPAA Business Associate Agreement
- [ ] Data Processing Agreement with hosting provider
- [ ] Security risk assessment
- [ ] Staff security training
- [ ] Incident response plan

## Quick Wins for Immediate Deployment 🚀

1. **Environment Variables**: Move all secrets to env vars
2. **Input Validation**: Add server-side validation
3. **Session Management**: Add auto-logout after inactivity
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive info in errors
5. **Logging**: Log access attempts and failures
